In recent months, three different colors of this spectacular utilitarian and minimalist model have been put on sale: a beautiful off-white color, in mustard and a very attractive white and blue. These are perfect sneakers for fall and we recommend wearing them with jogger pants."

Typical sneaker construction makes a return as a Primeknit upper is supported by a full-length BOOST midsole that's covered by a translucent sole unit. Lastly, while some looks have favored a white stripe, the classic SPLY-350 text appears in the shoe's shade of beige on the side stripe."
